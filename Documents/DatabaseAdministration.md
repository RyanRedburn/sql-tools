# Database Administration Considerations for Engineers

### Preamble
This document is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to database administration, but rather a list of items I think are often relevant to engineers. Some of the external materials linked in this document do provide recommendations and guidelines, but should not be considered all-encompassing. If you require more detailed material, there are numerous sources online and off that will give you what you seek.


## Main Contents

### Server Workload
Knowing what the server workload looks like will help you make decisions regarding various activities (e.g., what maintenance tasks should be performed, how to accomodate new workloads, etc.). You want to be aware not just of workload patterns and resource consumption by SQL Server, but also any other applications that may be running on a server.

### Server Versions/Editions
Ideally all servers will be on a fairly recent service pack/cumulative update and running a supported [version](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/321185/how-to-determine-the-version-edition-and-update-level-of-sql-server-an) of SQL Server. Additionally, you will want to know what editions are in use so you can assess what features are available and what limitations exists. Depending on the point in time you are reading this, it may also be important to consider the various engine changes made my Microsoft starting with SQL Server 2014.

**Database Engine Changes**
- 2014: [Cardinality Estimation Changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/cardinality-estimation-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017)

- 2019: [Intelligent Query Processing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing?view=sql-server-ver15)

**Edition Feature Comparisons**
- [2014](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/getting-started/features-supported-by-the-editions-of-sql-server-2014?view=sql-server-2014)
- [2016](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2016?view=sql-server-2017) (Significant differences to previous versions starting at SP1)
- [2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017?view=sql-server-2017)
- [2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-version-15?view=sql-server-ver15)

### Product SLA(s)
Considerations here include, but not limited to, recovery objectives, data retention, and access control. A product SLA will likely influence many operational areas and everyone working on the product should be aware of the relevant terms.

### Existing Maintenance Operations
Particularly when planning and implementing new maintenance operations, but even just more generally, you should be aware of what maintenance tasks are already being performed. This may elucidate opportunities to consolidate maintenance efforts, remove useless tasks, implement missing tasks, and plan/evaluate maintenance windows.

### Server Settings
Generally, there are only a handful of server settings that should be changed as part of regular server setup. Unless you have a specific reason (and evidence to back it up) you should not be changing the more esoteric settings (e.g., Optimize for Ad hoc Workloads). These blog posts from Brent Ozar Unlimited on [memory settings](https://www.brentozar.com/blitz/max-memory/) and other [miscellaneous settings](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2013/09/five-sql-server-settings-to-change/) are good starting points.

### Database Settings
Similar to server settings, you should not be changing database settings unless you have a good reason. The one obvious exception is the recovery model; you should change this as appropriate to match your backup/recovery strategy.

One setting that should be changed is the growth value for all database files. These should be set to reasonable values. See [this](https://www.brentozar.com/blitz/blitz-result-percent-growth-use/) blog post from Brent Ozar Unlimited.

There are a couple settings to watch when upgrading to earlier versions, as you may need to change them depending on your migration path. Page Verify should be set to CHECKSUM and the compatibility level should match the instance version unless you have a reason to keep it back. Make sure to test any relevant workloads/applications before moving the compatibility level forward.

### Tempdb Configuration
There are a few changes you typically want to make to tempdb for optimal performance. These include things such as having multiple, evenly sized data files and moving tempdb onto a separate drive. See [this](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2014/06/trace-flags-1117-1118-tempdb-configuration/) blog post from Brent Ozar Unlimited and [this](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sql_server_team/tempdb-files-and-trace-flags-and-updates-oh-my/) one from the SQL Server engineering team. Note that numerous changes have been made to the default tempdb configuration by Microsoft over the years (the previously linked Microsoft blog details some of these). If you’re looking for guides and/or information on configuring tempdb make sure you look at recent sources when possible.

### Table Types
In an OLTP system every table should be a clustered index unless you have a specific, quantifiable reason to use a heap. In an OLAP system, clustered [columnstore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview?view=sql-server-2017) indexes are also an option.

### Data Model and Distribution
It is good to have at least a general idea of what the data model and distribution looks like for any given database. This will help with maintenance activities such as data pruning, archiving, and performance tuning.

### Disabled Indexes/Constraints
Constraints and indexes exist for a reason and you should make sure that none are disabled. There are some valid scenarios (e.g., ETL processes) where these objects may be disabled, but it would typically only be for a set period of time. Be careful enabling indexes/constraints that you find disabled, as that may have undesirable consequences on the system. 

### Index Usage and Missing Indexes
Index usage and missing indexes are pieces of information you should periodically examine. Adding and removing indexes is one of many things that can be done to improve the health of the system. Make sure when doing index analysis to have data from a period of time that accurately captures all the various workloads handled by the server. Having a comprehensive dataset helps avoid removing indexes which may be needed by infrequently run processes and adding indexes which are less valuable than a few days’ worth of data may tell you.

### Table/Index Fragmentation
Monitoring and potentially [addressing](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/08/sql-server-index-fragmentation/) fragmentation isn’t necessarily a fruitless endeavor, but in the modern era this is less useful than in times past. Often a significant portion, if not the entirety, of your working data set (i.e., the data that is most often accessed) can be kept in memory. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEa6_QnCFMU) video from Brent Ozar details why defragmenting may not be helping (and may even be detrimental).

### Server Wait Stats
It’s a good idea to monitor instance wait stats. This may help you identify recurring problems (e.g., queries going parallel when they shouldn’t) and/or identify potential problems that haven’t surfaced in an obvious manner. [This](https://www.brentozar.com/sql/wait-stats/) blog post from Brent Ozar Unlimited and [this](https://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/wait-statistics-or-please-tell-me-where-it-hurts/) one from Paul Randel are good starting points for analyzing wait stats.

### Expensive Queries, Locking, and Blocking
Monitoring expensive queries, locking, and blocking will give you an idea of where to best direct performance tuning efforts. Similar to index tuning, this should be done periodically to ensure optimal system performance.
